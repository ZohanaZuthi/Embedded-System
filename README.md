# Embedded System Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded system programs developed using **Keil** and the **Arduino IDE**, targeting the **STM32F103C8** microcontroller (Blue Pill). The code demonstrates fundamental embedded concepts and peripheral interfacing.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion):**
  - Reading analog signals and converting them into digital values.
  - Example: Sensor data acquisition.

- **Keypad Interfacing:**
  - 4x4 matrix keypad scanning.
  - Detecting and decoding key presses using GPIO and interrupt methods.

- **SysTick Timer:**
  - Configuring the SysTick timer for time delays or periodic tasks.
  - Used for accurate delay generation and scheduling.

- **External Interrupts (EXTI):**
  - Handling external events (like button presses) asynchronously.
  - Configuration and ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) logic.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Microcontroller:** STM32F103C8 (ARM Cortex-M3)
- **Development Tools:**
  - Keil uVision IDE (for low-level C code)
  - Arduino IDE (for easier abstraction and prototyping)
- **Programming Language:** C
